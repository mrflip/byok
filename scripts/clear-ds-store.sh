# Deletes the .DS_Store files macOS Finder writes into the folders it shows, in the worktree it is
# run in, and nowhere else. One left behind keeps a folder git is emptying (in a rebase, or a
# worktree removal) from being deleted.
#
# It takes no arguments, so it cannot be pointed anywhere: the worktree is the one holding the
# current directory. It deletes only a regular file named exactly .DS_Store that belongs to that
# worktree (not to one nested inside it) and that git ignores, so what git sees never changes. It
# follows no symlink, crosses into no other filesystem, and skips .git and node_modules.
#
# The manual is notes/housekeeping.md, *Finder's .DS_Store files*.
#
# Written for the bash macOS ships (3.2) as well as a current one, and for BSD find as well as
# GNU find.
#
# Usage: scripts/clear-ds-store.sh
# Exits 0 when done, 1 on a failure, 2 when given any argument.
