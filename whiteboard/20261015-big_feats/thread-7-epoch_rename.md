# Thread 7: epoch_rename (2026-10-15)

Branch `20261015-epoch_rename`, PR [#84](https://github.com/mrflip/safebyok/pull/84), stacked on #77 (the line #71 → #76 → #73 → #78 → #74 → #77 → this). Justify: green (root 123, safebyok 909, convex 275, indexeddb 101, react 71, postgres 134, graphql 142, argon2-wasm 44, demo 124).

* **Built**: `passphrase_epoch` is `unlock_epoch` everywhere it is stored or compared: `VaultBundle` and `DeviceUnlock` (`types.ts`), `BundleExpectation` (`vault-db.ts`), `vault.ts`, `bundleOf` and `describeVaultDB` in `safebyok/testing`; `safebyok-indexeddb` (`expectations.ts`); `safebyok-convex` (validators, component `vaults.ts`); `safebyok-postgres` (`columns.ts`, `vault-tables.ts`, `vault-tables.sql`, the `UPDATE ... WHERE`); `safebyok-graphql` (SDL, `fields.ts`, resolvers, client). Also `passphraseEpoch` → `unlockEpoch` and "passphrase epoch" → "unlock epoch" in VOCABULARY, READMEs, `notes/security.md`, TODO, comments, tests. One changeset, `.changeset/20261015-epoch_rename.md`, five packages minor, naming the stored-shape change and the Postgres `ALTER TABLE`.
* **Decisions taken**:
  - The unreleased `20261015-unlock_envelopes` changeset was edited to the new name too, so the release notes never mention a field that does not exist.
  - Historical records (other threads' `whiteboard/` files, `human/`) are left as written; they describe what was true then.
  - Three comments and one test title saying a vault's "passphrase changed" now say its "unlocks changed" where the epoch is the point (`vault.ts`, convex `vaults.test.ts`). Tests about changing the passphrase itself keep their titles.
  - No test added: the renamed suites already prove the bundle, the expectation and each adapter's compare, and the old field is rejected by the strict schemas (an unknown key is stripped, a missing `unlock_epoch` fails).
* **Discoveries**: the demo names the field nowhere. Strict validation means an old-named record fails as `corrupt_record`, with no code to write.
* **For thread 8**: nothing left to rename; `maxLockboxes` goes in the same adapters as an addition.
