# Thread 3: tuple_ckeys (2026-10-15)

Branch `20261015-tuple_ckeys`, PR [#92](https://github.com/mrflip/safebyok/pull/92), stacked on
[#83](https://github.com/mrflip/safebyok/pull/83). Justify: green (root 123, safebyok 901,
safebyok-react 51, safebyok-convex 270, demo 125). `pnpm size` within budget.

* **Built**
  - `packages/safebyok/src/ckeys.ts`, imported as `Ckeys` and exported from the main entry:
    `bundle(scope)`, `box(scope, boxlabel)`, `unlock(scope)`, `boxPrefix(scope)` and
    `isBoxIn(scope)` (a predicate for `.filter`). Each ckey is `JSON.stringify([kind, applabel,
    user_id, vaultlabel(, boxlabel)])`, with kinds `vault`, `box` and `unlock`.
  - `vault-db.ts` (`localVaultDB`), `idb.ts` (`idbVaultDB`, `idbDeviceDB`) and `device-db.ts`
    (`memoryDeviceDB`) call it. `scopePath`, `bundleCkey`, `boxCkey`, `isBoxCkeyOf` and both
    `unlockCkey`s are gone.
  - `idbDeviceDB.eraseAll()` is now `clear()` on the device shelf, which holds only unlocks.
  - Tests: `tests/ckeys.test.ts`, and a `describeVaultDB` case (every adapter, Convex and the demo's
    included) for user ids differing only by `:` `"` `\` `,` `[` `]`. Old-format rows read as
    absent, tested for `localVaultDB`, `idbVaultDB` and `idbDeviceDB`. `MapVaultDB` (the
    "smallest honest adapter" in `vault-db.test.ts`) now uses `Ckeys`; its `/`-join was ambiguous.
  - The README has *Your own storage adapter*. There is a `notes/security.md` entry and a
    changeset (minor, stored format).
* **Decisions taken**
  - **JSON text everywhere, not IndexedDB array keys.** One encoding. `IdbRow.ckey` stays a
    string, and the demo's inspector panels stay readable. Array keys with a key range list faster
    only on a crowded shelf: 0.38 ms against 3.9 ms at 2,020 rows, and 0.10 ms against 0.25 ms at
    105 rows. A device shelf is small.
  - **Prefix only, no `JSON.parse` on listing.** The prefix is unambiguous on its own, because
    JSON string tokens are self-delimiting and our only `box` tuples have five elements. A
    listing never parses a ckey.
  - **`Ckeys` is public**, as a namespace. It gives adapter authors one place to call, and thread 4
    one function per kind. That costs `everything` 0.10 kB. `openVault` is unchanged.
  - **Kind first in the tuple**, so a vault's boxes share a prefix and kinds never mix.
* **Discoveries**
  - The measurements are in the PR body: bytes, and the memory and fake-indexeddb listings at 101
    and 2,020 rows. The method was a scratch Node script. It filled a `memoryStore`-like Map and
    an idb-keyval store with N vaults × M boxes under each encoding, then timed one vault's
    listing: a `:`-join with its no-colon check, a JSON prefix, `JSON.parse` of every ckey, and
    array keys with `getAll(IDBKeyRange.bound(prefix, [...prefix, []]))`. It wasn't committed:
    the root lints every `.mjs`.
  - A colon-join fails 10 of the 27 `ckeys.test.ts` cases (checked by mutating `encode`).
  - The demo's own fake auth (`demos/.../lib/auth.ts`) still uses `account:${applabel}:${userlabel}`.
    That's the demo's grammar for its own accounts, not a vault ckey. Left alone.
  - **For thread 4**: nothing in the ckeys needs a floor. Names are encoded as given, never
    normalized, so `é` and `e` + U+0301 are two vaults (and two cipher bindings): a validator must
    *check*, never transform, or the ckeys move too. `describeVaultDB`'s new case varies only
    `user_id`, because labels are still gated. Once thread 4 lifts the gate, add label cases to it
    (a vaultlabel or boxlabel holding `:`, `"`, `\`, `,`, `[`, `]`).
    `tests/ckeys.test.ts` already covers every position at the encoding level.
* **Review follow-up (YOLO, the orchestrator's directive)**: old remembered unlocks are swept.
  `idbDeviceDB`'s `readUnlock` and `eraseUnlock` run `keys()` on the device shelf and `delMany`
  every ckey that `Ckeys.isUnlock` (new) refuses. No old value is ever read, and a test spies on
  `IDBObjectStore.get`, `getAll` and `openCursor` to prove it. The first open after an upgrade
  sweeps, so `lock()` still forgets every unlock on the device. `memoryDeviceDB` keeps nothing past
  the page and needs no sweep. `isBoxIn`'s doc block states its invariant: every `box` tuple has
  exactly five elements.
* **For the Coach**
  - The old `unlock:…` rows no longer linger: they are swept unread at the first open (above).
    Old vault rows hold only ciphertext and stay, and the changeset says how to wipe them.
  - Upgrading a host on `idbVaultDB` or `localVaultDB` strands its users' vaults. They read
    `absent`, and the next unlock makes a new, empty one. That is per the plan, and the changeset
    says so plainly.
