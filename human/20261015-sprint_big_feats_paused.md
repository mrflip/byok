# 2026-10-15: Sprint big_feats paused for an hour, at the Coach's word

Paused at 10:18 UTC because the session was near its limit; it resumes about 11:19 UTC. Nothing is
filed or pushed except this sprint's own branch. Every stopped agent is resumed in place, with its
context, and finds its worktree as it left it.

| # | Thread            | Worktree                              | State at pause |
| - | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 | argon2_wasm       | `/workspace/byok-argon2_wasm`, on #68 `80ac694` | worker stopped mid-build: **all its work is uncommitted** (a new `packages/safebyok-argon2-wasm/`, plus edits to `key-deriver.ts`, `index.ts`, `.size-limit.json`, `package.json`, the lockfile, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `CLAUDE.md`). Resume the same worker; the CI and CLAUDE.md edits need its explanation before they ride. |
| 2 | unlock_envelopes  | `/workspace/byok-unlock_envelopes`, `c7fc91d` | built, `ready`; reviewer stopped mid-fix ("the aimed unlock on an absent vault"), with uncommitted edits to `vault.ts` and `vault.test.ts`. Resume the same reviewer. |
| 3 | passkey_unlock    | not cut                               | waits on thread 2 filing |
| 4 | indexeddb_package | not cut                               | base ready (#70 `d874db3`), waits for a slot |
| 5 | postgres_vaultdb  | `/workspace/byok-postgres_vaultdb`, `3976152` | built, `ready`; reviewer stopped early, nothing of its own in the tree. Resume the same reviewer. Before filing, rebases onto thread 2. |
| 6 | graphql_vaultdb   | not cut                               | waits on thread 5 filing |

Open for the Coach, already in chat and the sprint doc: thread 2's proof-for-every-envelope-change
rule, the epoch out of the envelope binding, and the ~4.8 s worst-case unaimed unlock.
